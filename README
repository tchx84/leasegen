inventario-leasegen is a Ruby-based application which communicates
with inventario.

leasegen requests a list of school servers from inventario.
inventario responds with a list of school servers, and for each school
in question, a list of laptop serial numbers and their UUIDs of the XOs
in the school.

leasegen then calls into bios-crypto, generating leases for the
specified laptops, saving the leases on disk.

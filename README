inventario-leasegen is a Ruby-based application which communicates
with inventario.

leasegen requests a list of school servers from inventario.
inventario responds with a list of school servers, and for each school
in question, a list of laptop serial numbers and their UUIDs of the XOs
in the school.

leasegen then calls into bios-crypto, generating leases for the
specified laptops, saving the leases on disk.

A list of stolen laptops is also saved in the output directory:
"serial,uuid" format (e.g. for oatslite) in stolen.csv
One-serial-per-line format (e.g. for XS) in stolen.list
